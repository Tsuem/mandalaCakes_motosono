# Mandala Cakes 
An e-commerce created for React course at Coderhouse. I tried to do an e-commerce to a cake shop in CÃ³rdoba with a pink girly style.  
In this project was included bootswatch and react-bootstrap as extra dependencies by npm.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
